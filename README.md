# Project 4
## This project is focused on the healthcare industry for identifying heart disease.
 * Our team evaluated the performance of various classification models based on recall results to determine the presence of heart disease.
 * Once we identify the best model, we can recommend it for detecting the presence of heart disease.

 **We use the following classification models:**
 * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):it categorize observations and choose class labels for data that are more similar to eachother.
 * Support Vector Machine (SVM):is a supervised learning model that we can use for classification and regression analysis.it separates classes of datapoint into multidimensional space.
 * Random Forest:it is an ensemblelearning method used for both classification and regression tasks.and it is less pron to overfitting.
 * Decision tree:it  is a powerful tool used for both classification and regression tasks. It helps in making decisions by breaking down complex decisions into simpler, more manageable parts.

 * LogisticRegression:it is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm widely used in statistics and machine learning
 * Neural Network: they are designed to recognize patterns and make predictions based on data.
    even if neural network is pron to overfitting on smaller dataset it has well done on identifying using heart disease.with recall value of 85%.
    we have checked the performance of the metrics(recall value ) on both test and train data.there is no sign of overfitting.the recall value on test and train data was not big different.
* we have used chart for visualize the recall value of the classification models.
